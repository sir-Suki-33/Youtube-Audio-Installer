# Youtube-Audio-Installer
I'm trying to improve the UI of this project, it's taking me a long time and I can't find a solution.

To completely be able to use this app you need to have installed ffmpeg from the following repository: [https://github.com/BtbN/FFmpeg-Builds/releases](url)
Then extract all filles in a simple locaction for example 'C:\ffmpeg' and then enter to 'Edit environment variables' (in Windows) and press 'Environment variables' button at the bottom of the window.
Next select the variable 'PATH' and press the 'Edit...' button.
Finally click on 'New' and write th path where you extracted the files for example 'C:\ffmpeg\bin', 'bin' is the folder in which the files .exe are located, soy you need to include it on the path.
Click on the 'Accept' button on each window and noy you have ffmpeg installed an included.
This can make it possible to convert the audio file to mp3 without any external tool.
